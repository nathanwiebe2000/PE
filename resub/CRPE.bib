A single target spin is coupled via the magnetic dipolar interaction to a large ensemble of spins. Applying radio frequency pulses, we can control the evolution so that the spin ensemble reaches one of two orthogonal states whose collective properties differ depending on the state of the target spin and are easily measured. We first describe this measurement process using quantum gates; then we show how equivalent schemes can be defined in terms of the Hamiltonian and thus implemented under conditions of real control, using well established {NMR} techniques. We demonstrate this method with a proof of principle experiment in ensemble liquid state {NMR} and simulations for small spin systems.},

Randomized benchmarking reduces the difficulty of this task by exploiting symmetries in quantum operations. Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in the reported fidelities. We also show that our approach is useful for physical devices by comparing to simulations.},

All control is achieved via actuator-only modulation, leading to fast implementations of a universal set of internode quantum gates. The method is expected to be nearly independent of actuator decoherence and may be made insensitive to experimental variations of system parameters by appropriate design of control sequences.

It is shown here that our specific smoothing approaches can interpret and suggest modifications to techniques that add "artificial evolution noise" to fixed model parameters at each time point to address problems of sample attrition and prior:data conflict. Our new approach permits smoothing and regeneration of sample points of model parameters without the "loss of historical information" inherent in earlier methods; this is achieved using shrinkage modifications of kernel smoothing, as introduced by the second author in the early 1990s. Following some theoretical development, discussion and a small simulated example to demonstrate its efficacy, we report some experiences in using the method in a challenging application in multivariate dynamic factor models for financial time series, as recently studied using straight {MCMC} methods by the second author and other collaborators.

Here, we show that the conventional paradigm of quantum measurement is directly responsible for a well-known disparity between the resources required to extract information from quantum and classical systems. We introduce a simple form of quantum data gathering, “coherent measurement”, that eliminates this disparity and restores a pleasing symmetry between classical and quantum statistical inference. To illustrate the power of quantum data gathering, we demonstrate that coherent measurements are optimal and strictly more powerful than conventional one-at-a-time measurements for the task of discriminating quantum states, including certain entangled many-body states (e.g., matrix product states).},

We demonstrate that this increased risk is unavoidable and intrinsic to noisy coins, by constructing minimax estimators (numerically). However, minimax estimators introduce extreme bias in return for slight improvements in the worst-case risk. So we introduce a pointwise lower bound on the minimum achievable risk as an alternative to the minimax criterion, and use this bound to show that {HML} estimators are pretty good. We conclude with a survey of scientific applications of the noisy coin model in social science, physical science, and quantum information science.},

We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been employed in the determin-istic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions. Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

	abstract = {Projective measurements of a single two-level quantum mechanical system (a qubit) evolving under a time-independent Hamiltonian produce a probability distribution that is periodic in the evolution time. The period of this distribution is an important parameter in the Hamiltonian. Here, we explore how to design experiments so as to minimize error in the estimation of this parameter. While it has been shown that useful results may be obtained by minimizing the risk incurred by each experiment, such an approach is computationally intractable in general. Here, we motivate and derive heuristic strategies for experiment design that enjoy the same exponential scaling as fully optimized strategies. We then discuss generalizations to the case of finite relaxation times, T 2 {\textless} ∞.},

	abstract = {Identifying an accurate model for the dynamics of a quantum system is a vexing problem that underlies a range of problems in experimental physics and quantum information theory. Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are noise free. Here we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm works for noncommuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.},

We provide an algorithm that, under relatively weak assumptions, can be used to efficiently infer the Hamiltonian of a large but untrusted quantum simulator using a trusted quantum simulator. We illustrate the power of this approach by showing numerically that it can inexpensively learn the Hamiltonians for large frustrated Ising models, demonstrating that quantum resources can make certifying analog quantum simulators tractable.},

Very recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the Haar measure. In this work we show that in this setup, with probability exponentially close to one in the number of bosons, no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the Boson-Sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than exponentially many samples. This means that the two distributions are operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge. We carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the implemented unitary for devising non-symmetric algorithms that could potentially improve upon this. We conclude that due to the very fact that Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard, efficient classical certification of Boson-Sampling devices seems to be out of reach.},

We describe a mechanism for the appearance of irreversibility that applies to coherent, isolated systems in a pure quantum state. This equilibration mechanism requires only an assumption of sufficiently complex internal dynamics and natural information-theoretic constraints arising from the infeasibility of collecting an astronomical amount of measurement data. Remarkably, we are able to prove that irreversibility can be understood as typical without assuming decoherence or restricting to coarse-grained observables, and hence occurs under distinct conditions and time scales from those implied by the usual decoherence point of view. We illustrate the effect numerically in several model systems and prove that the effect is typical under the standard random-matrix conjecture for complex quantum systems.},

However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, because analytic solutions rarely exist and because the best long-range bound is too loose to accurately describe the relevant dynamical timescales for any known spin model. Here we apply a variable-range Ising spin chain Hamiltonian and a variable-range {XY} spin chain Hamiltonian to a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system and observe its time evolution.

	abstract = {We investigate the stability of a Sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC}) method applied to the problem of sampling from a target distribution on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ for large \$d\$. It is well known that using a single importance sampling step one produces an approximation for the target that deteriorates as the dimension \$d\$ increases, unless the number of Monte Carlo samples \$N\$ increases at an exponential rate in \$d\$. We show that this degeneracy can be avoided by introducing a sequence of artificial targets, starting from a `simple' density and moving to the one of interest, using an {SMC} method to sample from the sequence. Using this class of {SMC} methods with a fixed number of samples, one can produce an approximation for which the effective sample size ({ESS}) converges to a random variable \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_N\$ as \$d{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$ with \$1{\textless}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N\}{\textless}N\$. The convergence is achieved with a computational cost proportional to \$Nd{\textasciicircum}2\$. If \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_N{\textbackslash}ll N\$, we can raise its value by introducing a number of resampling steps, say \$m\$ (where \$m\$ is independent of \$d\$). In this case, {ESS} converges to a random variable \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N,m\}\$ as \$d{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$ and \${\textbackslash}lim\_\{m{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N,m\}=N\$. Also, we show that the Monte Carlo error for estimating a fixed dimensional marginal expectation is of order \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\}\$ uniformly in \$d\$. The results imply that, in high dimensions, {SMC} algorithms can efficiently control the variability of the importance sampling weights and estimate fixed dimensional marginals at a cost which is less than exponential in \$d\$ and indicate that, in high dimensions, resampling leads to a reduction in the Monte Carlo error and increase in the {ESS}.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in quantum information processing have presented new and interesting ways to perform advanced algorithms and improve signal to noise ratios. Examples of these include optimal control theory pulse generation algorithms and the usage of high Q-factor resonators. However, these developments are blocked by current spectrometer designs. This thesis details the design and testing of a new spectrometer with sufficient accuracy, bandwidth, and control to implement these advances. The proposed solution is to use an FPGA-based development board together with custom computer software. This gives access to high-speed analogue inputs and outputs, as well as digital output pins. The spectrometer is then used in two X-band electron spin resonance experiments, showing how the advantages of the system allow for superior results to that possible with the previous equipment. In addition, the setup is used in a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) system where a rabi experiment is performed.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

As these physical qubits continue to advance, meeting the challenge of realizing a quantum machine will also require the development of new supporting devices and control architectures with complexity far beyond the systems used in today’s few-qubit experiments. Here, we report a microarchitecture for controlling and reading out qubits during the execution of a quantum algorithm such as an error-correcting code. We demonstrate the basic principles of this architecture using a cryogenic switch matrix implemented via high-electron-mobility transistors and a new kind of semiconductor device based on gate-switchable capacitance. The switch matrix is used to route microwave waveforms to qubits under the control of a field-programmable gate array, also operating at cryogenic temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest a viable approach for controlling large-scale quantum systems using semiconductor technology.},

	abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences. However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

However, they are intractably hard to construct in general. This paper reports on a numerical approximation to HPD regions for the purpose of testing a much more computationally and conceptually convenient class of regions: posterior covariance ellipsoids (PCEs). The PCEs are defined via the covariance matrix of the posterior probability distribution of states. Here it is shown that PCEs are near optimal for the example of Pauli measurements on multiple qubits. Moreover, the algorithm is capable of producing accurate PCE regions even when there is uncertainty in the model.},

The Condensation algorithm uses “factored sampling”, previously applied to the interpretation of static images, in which the probability distribution of possible interpretations is represented by a randomly generated set. Condensation uses learned dynamical models, together with visual observations, to propagate the random set over time. The result is highly robust tracking of agile motion. Notwithstanding the use of stochastic methods, the algorithm runs in near real-time.},

We use advanced search techniques based on swarm optimization to design better adaptive measurements that can provide improved measurement accuracy with low-visibility interferometry, with applications in nitrogen-vacancy-center magnetometry.},

We prove that it is not possible to realize the canonical measurement by counting photons in the outputs of the interferometer, even if an adjustable auxiliary phase shift is allowed in the interferometer. However, we introduce a feedback algorithm based on Bayesian inference to control this auxiliary phase shift. This makes the measurement close to a canonical one, with a phase variance scaling slightly above N-2. With no feedback, the best result (given that the phase to be measured is completely unknown) is a scaling of N-1. For optimal input states having up to four photons, our feedback scheme is the best possible one, but for higher photon numbers more complicated schemes perform marginally better.},
