	abstract = {We propose a new approach to the measurement of a single spin state, based on nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) techniques and inspired by the coherent control over many-body systems envisaged by quantum information processing. A single target spin is coupled via the magnetic dipolar interaction to a large ensemble of spins. Applying radio frequency pulses, we can control the evolution so that the spin ensemble reaches one of two orthogonal states whose collective properties differ depending on the state of the target spin and are easily measured. We first describe this measurement process using quantum gates; then we show how equivalent schemes can be defined in terms of the Hamiltonian and thus implemented under conditions of real control, using well established {NMR} techniques. We demonstrate this method with a proof of principle experiment in ensemble liquid state {NMR} and simulations for small spin systems.},

In particular we argue that indirect addressing of the nuclear spins via an electron spin acting as a spin actuator allows for nuclear spin quantum logic gates whose operational times are significantly faster than either gates based on rf fields resonant with nuclear spin flips or nuclear-nuclear dipolar interactions. We demonstrate experimental aspects of this method with one electron and one nuclear spin of a single crystal of irradiated malonic acid.},

That is, we must be able to determine whether we have implemented a desired gate, and refine accordingly. Randomized benchmarking reduces the difficulty of this task by exploiting symmetries in quantum operations. Here, we bound the resources required for benchmarking and show that, with prior information, we can achieve several orders of magnitude better accuracy than in traditional approaches to benchmarking. Moreover, by building on state-of-the-art classical algorithms, we reach these accuracies with near-optimal resources. Our approach requires an order of magnitude less data to achieve the same accuracies and to provide online estimates of the errors in the reported fidelities. We also show that our approach is useful for physical devices by comparing to simulations.},

All control is achieved via actuator-only modulation, leading to fast implementations of a universal set of internode quantum gates. The method is expected to be nearly independent of actuator decoherence and may be made insensitive to experimental variations of system parameters by appropriate design of control sequences.

We discuss a general approach that combines old ideas of smoothing using kernel methods with newer ideas of auxilliary particle filtering. It is shown here that our specific smoothing approaches can interpret and suggest modifications to techniques that add "artificial evolution noise" to fixed model parameters at each time point to address problems of sample attrition and prior:data conflict. Our new approach permits smoothing and regeneration of sample points of model parameters without the "loss of historical information" inherent in earlier methods; this is achieved using shrinkage modifications of kernel smoothing, as introduced by the second author in the early 1990s. Following some theoretical development, discussion and a small simulated example to demonstrate its efficacy, we report some experiences in using the method in a challenging application in multivariate dynamic factor models for financial time series, as recently studied using straight {MCMC} methods by the second author and other collaborators. Some summary comments and comparisons with {MCMC} methods are given in this applied context.},

Both these approaches yield a significant reduction in resources compared to tomography.

We introduce a simple form of quantum data gathering, ‚Äúcoherent measurement‚Äù, that eliminates this disparity and restores a pleasing symmetry between classical and quantum statistical inference. To illustrate the power of quantum data gathering, we demonstrate that coherent measurements are optimal and strictly more powerful than conventional one-at-a-time measurements for the task of discriminating quantum states, including certain entangled many-body states (e.g., matrix product states).},

We study this problem using entropy risk to quantify estimators' accuracy. We generalize the "add Beta" estimators that work well for noiseless coins, and we find that these hedged maximum-likelihood ({HML}) estimators achieve a worst-case risk of O(N{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}) on noisy coins, in contrast to O(1/N) in the noiseless case. We demonstrate that this increased risk is unavoidable and intrinsic to noisy coins, by constructing minimax estimators (numerically). However, minimax estimators introduce extreme bias in return for slight improvements in the worst-case risk. So we introduce a pointwise lower bound on the minimum achievable risk as an alternative to the minimax criterion, and use this bound to show that {HML} estimators are pretty good. We conclude with a survey of scientific applications of the noisy coin model in social science, physical science, and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {Accurately inferring the state of a quantum device from the results of measurements is a crucial task in building quantum information processing hardware. The predominant state estimation procedure, maximum likelihood estimation ({MLE}), generally reports an estimate with zero eigenvalues. These cannot be justified. Furthermore, the {MLE} estimate is incompatible with error bars, so conclusions drawn from it are suspect. I propose an alternative procedure, Bayesian mean estimation ({BME}). {BME} never yields zero eigenvalues, its eigenvalues provide a bound on their own uncertainties, and under certain circumstances it is provably the most accurate procedure possible. I show how to implement {BME} numerically, and how to obtain natural error bars that are compatible with the estimate. Finally, I briefly discuss the differences between Bayesian and frequentist estimation techniques.},

We describe algorithms that achieve significant advantages for the electronic-structure problem, the simulation of chemical dynamics, protein folding, and other tasks.

These methods are of particular interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models that are typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling framework is developed that unifies many of the methods which have been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed. We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been employed in the determin-istic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions. Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are noise free. Here we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm works for noncommuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.},

We provide an algorithm that, under relatively weak assumptions, can be used to efficiently infer the Hamiltonian of a large but untrusted quantum simulator using a trusted quantum simulator.

This is achieved by adapting measurement settings by feeding back already obtained data. Both \$g\$ and \${\textbackslash}omega\_r\$ are determined simultaneously.

Very recently, a rush of experimental activity has ignited with the aim of developing such devices as feasible instances of quantum simulators. Even approximate Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard with high probability if the unitary describing the optical network is drawn from the Haar measure. In this work we show that in this setup, with probability exponentially close to one in the number of bosons, no symmetric algorithm can distinguish the Boson-Sampling distribution from the uniform one from fewer than exponentially many samples. This means that the two distributions are operationally indistinguishable without detailed a priori knowledge. We carefully discuss the prospects of efficiently using knowledge about the implemented unitary for devising non-symmetric algorithms that could potentially improve upon this. We conclude that due to the very fact that Boson-Sampling is believed to be hard, efficient classical certification of Boson-Sampling devices seems to be out of reach.},

We describe a mechanism for the appearance of irreversibility that applies to coherent, isolated systems in a pure quantum state. This equilibration mechanism requires only an assumption of sufficiently complex internal dynamics and natural information-theoretic constraints arising from the infeasibility of collecting an astronomical amount of measurement data. Remarkably, we are able to prove that irreversibility can be understood as typical without assuming decoherence or restricting to coarse-grained observables, and hence occurs under distinct conditions and time scales from those implied by the usual decoherence point of view. We illustrate the effect numerically in several model systems and prove that the effect is typical under the standard random-matrix conjecture for complex quantum systems.},

Here a nuclear spin-based quantum simulator is used to study the spreading of information in such a dipolar-coupled system. While the information spreads with no apparent limits in the case of ideal dipolar couplings, additional perturbations limit the spreading, leading to localization. In previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 230403 (2010)], it was found that the system size reaches a dynamic equilibrium that decreases with the square of the perturbation strength.

	abstract = {The maximum speed with which information can propagate in a quantum many-body system directly affects how quickly disparate parts of the system can become correlated and how difficult the system will be to describe numerically. For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective /`light cone/'. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, because analytic solutions rarely exist and because the best long-range bound is too loose to accurately describe the relevant dynamical timescales for any known spin model. Here we apply a variable-range Ising spin chain Hamiltonian and a variable-range {XY} spin chain Hamiltonian to a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system and observe its time evolution. For several different interaction ranges, we determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations, extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. This work opens the possibility for studying a wide range of many-body dynamics in quantum systems that are otherwise intractable.},

	title = {On the Stability of Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in High Dimensions},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3965},
	abstract = {We investigate the stability of a Sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC}) method applied to the problem of sampling from a target distribution on \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ for large \$d\$. It is well known that using a single importance sampling step one produces an approximation for the target that deteriorates as the dimension \$d\$ increases, unless the number of Monte Carlo samples \$N\$ increases at an exponential rate in \$d\$. We show that this degeneracy can be avoided by introducing a sequence of artificial targets, starting from a `simple' density and moving to the one of interest, using an {SMC} method to sample from the sequence. Using this class of {SMC} methods with a fixed number of samples, one can produce an approximation for which the effective sample size ({ESS}) converges to a random variable \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_N\$ as \$d{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$ with \$1{\textless}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N\}{\textless}N\$. The convergence is achieved with a computational cost proportional to \$Nd{\textasciicircum}2\$. If \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_N{\textbackslash}ll N\$, we can raise its value by introducing a number of resampling steps, say \$m\$ (where \$m\$ is independent of \$d\$). In this case, {ESS} converges to a random variable \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N,m\}\$ as \$d{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty\$ and \${\textbackslash}lim\_\{m{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty\}{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{N,m\}=N\$. Also, we show that the Monte Carlo error for estimating a fixed dimensional marginal expectation is of order \${\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{{\textbackslash}sqrt\{N\}\}\$ uniformly in \$d\$. The results imply that, in high dimensions, {SMC} algorithms can efficiently control the variability of the importance sampling weights and estimate fixed dimensional marginals at a cost which is less than exponential in \$d\$ and indicate that, in high dimensions, resampling leads to a reduction in the Monte Carlo error and increase in the {ESS}.},

Examples of these include optimal control theory pulse generation algorithms and the usage of high Q-factor resonators. However, these developments are blocked by current spectrometer designs. This thesis details the design and testing of a new spectrometer with sufficient accuracy, bandwidth, and control to implement these advances. The proposed solution is to use an FPGA-based development board together with custom computer software. This gives access to high-speed analogue inputs and outputs, as well as digital output pins. The spectrometer is then used in two X-band electron spin resonance experiments, showing how the advantages of the system allow for superior results to that possible with the previous equipment. In addition, the setup is used in a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) system where a rabi experiment is performed.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

As these physical qubits continue to advance, meeting the challenge of realizing a quantum machine will also require the development of new supporting devices and control architectures with complexity far beyond the systems used in today‚Äôs few-qubit experiments. Here, we report a microarchitecture for controlling and reading out qubits during the execution of a quantum algorithm such as an error-correcting code. We demonstrate the basic principles of this architecture using a cryogenic switch matrix implemented via high-electron-mobility transistors and a new kind of semiconductor device based on gate-switchable capacitance. The switch matrix is used to route microwave waveforms to qubits under the control of a field-programmable gate array, also operating at cryogenic temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest a viable approach for controlling large-scale quantum systems using semiconductor technology.},

However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted.

Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students‚Äîall in the field of psychology‚Äîwere asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers‚Äô performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

The PCEs are defined via the covariance matrix of the posterior probability distribution of states. Here it is shown that PCEs are near optimal for the example of Pauli measurements on multiple qubits. Moreover, the algorithm is capable of producing accurate PCE regions even when there is uncertainty in the model.},
